# This is SET 2 of the project. The rules are the following:


1. Assuming a universe represented as an arrays, write a program to represent the set X , given the arrays representing X.

2. Assuming the same as previous exercise, write a program that finds the composition R o S of relations R and S.

3. Write a program that prints the amount accumulated yearly if a person invests n dollars at p percent compound annually. Write the program using two versions: (a) Using iterative solution (b) Recursive solution.

4. Implement pre-order tree traversals as program.

##These problems must be completed in order to conclude this set.
