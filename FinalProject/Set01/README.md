# This is SET 1 of the project. The rules are the following:

1. Write a program to determine whether X = Y given arrays representing X and Y.

2. Assume that a sequence from [1,â€¦,n] to the real numbers is represented as an array A, indexed from 1 to n. Write a program that finds the inverse of a relation.

3. Write a program that prints the amount accumulated yearly if a person invests n dollars at p percent annual interest compounded m times yearly. Write the program using two versions: (a) Using iterative solution (b) Recursive solution.

4. Write a program that tests if a graph is a tree.

##These problems must be completed in order to conclude this set.
