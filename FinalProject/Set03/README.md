# This is SET 3 of the project. The rules are the following:

1. Assume that a sequence from [1,â€¦,n] to the real numbers is represented as an array A, indexed from 1 to n. Write a program that finds the inverse of a relation.

2. Write a program that prints the amount accumulated yearly if a person invests n dollars at p percent compound annually. Write the program using two versions: (a) Using iterative solution (b) Recursive solution.

3. Implement post-order tree traversals as program.

4. Implement in-order tree traversals as program.

##These problems must be completed in order to conclude this set.
